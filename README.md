# Description 
Here I am impelemting mini projects using nothing but HTML5, CSS & JavaScript. No JS or CSS frameworks, no libraries, etc.


## Projects 1 - Seat Booking
Seat Booking visualization which can be found in every cinema. Random generation of occupied seats and counter of selected seats based on the selected movie. 

Here I used DOM + CSS only.

## Project 2 - Todo List 
Here is nothing to say, just most frequent task which implements every newbie. 

DOM + LocalStorage + CSS

## Project 3 - Infinite Scrolling 
Blog posts loading from implementation. DataBase imitation via jsonplaceholder and fetch requests

SetTimeout + Asyn/Await + CSS Loader
